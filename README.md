## About
This portfolio website consists of multiple projects that I made in the process of learning different front-end programming languages and frameworks. 
## Projects
### [Landing Page](https://misakowatanabe.github.io/ "Let's go")
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Media-Queries
- Google API - Fonts and icons
- AOS - Animation
- Pure Drawer

The landing page contains my project links. Resposive design was adopted with navigation bar and drawer. I adopted some elements, which change its states depending on scrolling, to make a user experience easier.


### [Time Message](https://misakowatanabe.github.io/timemessage/index.html "Let's go")
- Pure Javascript
- API - Background images

Random messages are created based on time using DOM maniplation. External API was adopted to show random images in the background.


### [To-Do List](https://misakowatanabe.github.io/todolist/index.html "Let's go")
- Pure Javascript
- Media-Queries
- API - Background images

Simple list with some small DOM maniplation to make the user experience more intuitive. External API was adopted to show random images in the background.
