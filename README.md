# Misako's Portfolio

This portfolio website consists of multiple projects that I made in the process of learning different front-end programming languages and frameworks.
 
## Projects
### [Landing Page](https://misakowatanabe.github.io/ "Let's go")

The landing page contains my project links. Responsive design was adopted with navigation bar and drawer as well as some other features, which change its states depending on scrolling to make a user experience easier.

- React JS
- Material-UI

This web app gives you customized suggestions of what to do depending on your input.
